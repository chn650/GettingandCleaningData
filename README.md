Getting and Cleaning Data
======================


How to execute the R script
-----------------------------
1. Unzip the [data] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) in your working directory. You will have a folder called `UCI HAR Dataset`. Rename the folder to `data`.

2. Put `run_analysis.R` in your working directory.

3. Run `source("run_analysis.R")`.

4. The following files will be created in the `data` folder: 
 - `merged_data.txt`: the training and test sets merged into one data set, containing only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Dimension: 10299x68
 - `tidy_data.txt`: data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Dimension: 180x68

5. Use `read.table("./data/merged_data.txt"", header=TRUE)` and `read.table("./data/tidy_data.txt", header=TRUE)` to read the data sets.
