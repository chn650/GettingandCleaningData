2. Put `run_analysis.R` in your working directory.

3. Run `source("run_analysis.R")`.

4. The following files will be created in your working directory:
        * `merged_data.txt`
        * `tidy_data.txt`

5. Use `data <- read.table("tidy_data.txt")` to read the tidy data set. This is a 180x68 data frame.
