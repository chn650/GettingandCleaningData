======================

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.[1]

The `run_analysis.R` file will create two files:
 - `merged_data.txt`: the training and test sets merged into one data set, containing only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Dimension: 10299x68
 - `tidy_data.txt`: data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Dimension: 180x68
 
 

Transformation steps
---------------------
For the `merged_data.txt`:

1. Merge training and testing data for measurements, activities and subjects.
 -  measurements are binded into a 10299x561 data frame
 -  activities are binded into a 10299x1 data frame
 -  subjects are binded into a 10299x1 data frame

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 - This changes the measurements data frame to a 10299x66 data frame
 
3. Link the class labels with their activity name, so we see the activity not numbers.
 - The activity names are changed from upper case to lowercase.
 - The "_" in the activity names are removed
 
4. Merge the data for subjects, activities and measurements in one data set.
 - This creates a 10299x68 data frame

5. Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
 - variable names are changed to being all lower case, because missing caps can lead to difficult to find bugs in data analysis
 - The "-" and "()" are removed from the variable names, because these characters are not allowed in R names. If you read the data into are these characters will be converted into a "."


For the `tidy_data.txt`:

1. Melt the data rom the `merged_data.txt` so that each row is a unique id-variable combination. The activity and subject are used as id.
 - This creates a 679734x4 data frame
 
2. Cast the melted data into a new data frame with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 - This creates a 180x68 data frame



Description Variables 
---------------------
subject: the numbers 1 to 30 represent the individuals that participated in the study

activity: the subjects performed 6 different activities (laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs)

The other variables are a combination the following:
* t: time domain signal
* f: frequency domain signal
* body: body motion components
* gravity:gravitational motion components
* acc: accelerometer signal
* jerk: body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived in time
* gyro: gyroscope signal 
* mag: magnitude of the signals
* mean: average
* std: standard deviation
* x: x-axis of the three-dimensional signals
* y: y-axis of the three-dimensional signals
* z: z-axis of the three-dimensional signals
